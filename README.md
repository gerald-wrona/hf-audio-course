I was curious to work with audio data and grateful for this introduction provided by Huggingface. This was an engaging course with exciting projects and I became engrossed. Pausing my work to pursue other interests, but hope to return some day when I have a use case.

Credit to the HuggingFace team for creating the course and designing the HF architecture that supports it.
